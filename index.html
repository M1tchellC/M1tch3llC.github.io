    <p>Welcome to my website! This is where I have a few of my projects posted, and I will be adding to the page every once in a while. More projects and information may be available upon request <a href=#contactinfo>(See Contact Info) </a>. This website was made by me during July 2025 and I have been learning some HTML, CSS and JavaScript (including jQuery) in my spare time, along with the several other programming languages I have learned in my coursework or on my own.</p>

    <p> Hello once again, and if it wasn't obvious my name is Mitchell Carney! I have been working with computers since at least middle school, although, really it started much before that.
    In elementary school I was able to mess around a little with Scratch, which is a simple drag-and-drop coding site. My interest in computers grew throughout the remainder of my K-12 years.
    In fact, some of the projects you see below I completed in high school, when I learned Python for the first time (My first <em>real</em> experience with coding). In 2020 I started at Saint Petersburg Collegiate High School where I studied Dual Enrolled at Saint Petersburg College for an AA in Computer Science.
    I was able to learn some C and C++ there and graduated in 2023. In fall of 2023 I started at USF, where I currently am working on my Bachelors in Computer Engineering (Set to graduate May 2026).
    I switched to the Computer Engineering route becuase I felt it was a more versatile major, and I do have an interest in both Hardware and Software (but primarily software).
    At USF I have continued to learn more C and Python, while recently, in summer 2025 I took the Global Career Accelerator where I learned to work with Python and SQL to analyze databases, while also studying HTML, CSS and JavaScript independently.

    <div class = myimage1 onclick="changeimage();"><img src="mypc.jpg" alt = "My picture" width="200" height="200"/> <p class = caption1>The inside of the PC I built</p></div>
    <script>
            $('.myimage1').click(function() {
                alert("Switching to a better picture");
                $(this).fadeOut(1000, function() {
                    $('.myimage2').fadeIn(1000);
                });
            });

    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Programming Languages I Know:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>C/C++</li>
        <li>SQL</li>
        <Li>HTML, CSS & JavaScript (Learning)</Li>
    </ul></br>
    <p style="font-size:20px;">Some of My Hobbies Include:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
        <li>Reading</li>
        <li>Playing Video Games on my PC</li>
        <li>Watching Youtube videos</li>
        <li>Learning new skills</li>
    </ul><br>
    <p style="font-size:20px;">Where I've Worked:</p>
    <p>My first work experience was helping the Media Specialist at Gulf Beaches Elementary Magnet School (2021-2023), this was volunteer work being done for my bright futures scholarship. During my time there
    I created spreadsheets detailing the school library inventory, including computers, ipads, books and other technology. Later at the same school (2022-2024) I ended up doing tutoring and some afterschool clubs related to the areas of STEM as well. Some of the skills
    I learned in these roles were how to explain new concepts to others and and some organization skills. Starting in 2024 I began doing some work for Mad Science of Greater Tampa Bay doing similar things, making spreadsheets, organizing resources, and made a company Onedrive so that the
    company files could be accessed remotely as needed. In these roles I also have done some video/photo editing work. In summer of 2025 I participated in the Global Career Accelerator: Coding For Data where I worked with both Python and SQL to analyze datasets in order to make data-backed conclusions and recommendations.
    Some of my projects from the experience are included below.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 20px;"> </br>This is link is a SQL project I did with the Global Career Accelerator working with data from Intel to determine which devices provide the most positive enviromental impact when recycled.</p>   
    <a style="font-size: 32px;" href="SQL_Project.pdf">Global Career Accelerator SQL Project</a>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"> </br>This is link is a Python project I did with the Global Career Accelerator to investigate website viewership statistics for both the Grammy and Recording Academy Websites to determine if they performed better independently or together.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 20px;"> </br>The rest of this page was made up from mainly HTML and CSS features (aside from the date and time at the top), how about some more JavaScript though?</p>
    <button onclick="alert('Try clicking on the picture of my PC to see some more JavaScript features');" type="button"> Want to see some JavaScript and jQuery in action?</button>
