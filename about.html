    <p> Hello once again, and if it wasn't obvious my name is Mitchell Carney! I have been working with computers since at least middle school, although, really it started much before that.
    In elementary school I was able to mess around a little with Scratch, which is a simple drag-and-drop coding site. My interest in computers grew throughout the remainder of my K-12 years.
    In fact, some of the projects you see below I completed in high school, when I learned Python for the first time (My first <em>real</em> experience with coding). In 2020 I started at Saint Petersburg Collegiate High School where I studied Dual Enrolled at Saint Petersburg College for an AA in Computer Science.
    I was able to learn some C and C++ there and graduated in 2023. In fall of 2023 I started at USF, where I currently am working on my Bachelors in Computer Engineering (Set to graduate May 2026).
    I switched to the Computer Engineering route becuase I felt it was a more versatile major, and I do have an interest in both Hardware and Software (but primarily software).
    At USF I have continued to learn more C and Python, while recently, in summer 2025 I took the Global Career Accelerator where I learned to work with Python and SQL to analyze databases, while also studying HTML, CSS and JavaScript independently.

    <div class = myimage2><img src="pcpic.jpg" alt = "My picture" width="300" height="200"/> <p class = caption1>The inside of the PC I built</p></div>
    <div class = myimage1 onclick="changeimage();"><img src="mypc.jpg" alt = "My picture" width="200" height="200"/> <p class = caption1>The inside of the PC I built</p></div>
    <script>
            $('.myimage1').click(function() {
                alert("That image had quite a glare and wasn't very good, how about this one?");
                $(this).fadeOut(1000, function() {
                    $('.myimage2').fadeIn(1000);
                });
            });

    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Programming Languages I Know:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>C/C++</li>
        <li>SQL</li>
        <Li>HTML, CSS & JavaScript (Learning)</Li>
    </ul></br>
    <p style="font-size:20px;">Some of My Hobbies Include:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
        <li>Reading</li>
        <li>Playing Video Games on my PC</li>
        <li>Watching Youtube videos</li>
        <li>Learning new skills</li>
    </ul><br>
    <p style="font-size:20px;">Where I've Worked:</p>
    <p>My first work experience was helping the Media Specialist at Gulf Beaches Elementary Magnet School (2021-2023), this was volunteer work being done for my bright futures scholarship. During my time there
    I created spreadsheets detailing the school library inventory, including computers, ipads, books and other technology. Later at the same school (2022-2024) I ended up doing tutoring and some afterschool clubs related to the areas of STEM as well. Some of the skills
    I learned in these roles were how to explain new concepts to others and and some organization skills. Starting in 2024 I began doing some work for Mad Science of Greater Tampa Bay doing similar things, making spreadsheets, organizing resources, and made a company Onedrive so that the
    company files could be accessed remotely as needed. In these roles I also have done some video/photo editing work. In summer of 2025 I participated in the Global Career Accelerator: Coding For Data where I worked with both Python and SQL to analyze datasets in order to make data-backed conclusions and recommendations.
    Some of my projects from the experience are included on the projects page.</p>
