    <p> Hello once again, and if it wasn't obvious my name is Mitchell Carney! I have been working with computers since at least middle school, although, really it started much before that.
    In elementary school I was able to mess around a little with Scratch, which is a simple drag-and-drop coding site. My interest in computers grew throughout the remainder of my K-12 years.
    In fact, some of the projects you see below I completed in high school, when I learned Python for the first time (My first <em>real</em> experience with coding). In 2020 I started at Saint Petersburg Collegiate High School where I studied Dual Enrolled at Saint Petersburg College for an AA in Computer Science.
    I was able to learn some C and C++ there and graduated in 2023. In fall of 2023 I started at USF, where I currently am working on my Bachelors in Computer Engineering (Set to graduate Decemeber 2026).
    I switched to the Computer Engineering route becuase I felt it was a more versatile major, and I do have an interest in both Hardware and Software (but primarily software).
    At USF I have continued to learn more C, C++ and Python, while in summer 2025 I took the Global Career Accelerator where I learned to work with Python and SQL to analyze databases, while also studying HTML, CSS and JavaScript independently to begin developing this website. In December 2025 and 2026 I continued my full-stack learning
    by completing freeCodeCamp's JavaScript Development certification, projects from these mentioned experiences can be found <a href="https://m1tchellc.github.io/M1tch3llC.github.io/projects.html">here</a>.

    <div class = myimage2><img src="pcpic.jpg" alt = "My picture" width="300" height="200"/> <p class = caption1>The inside of the PC I built</p></div>
    <div class = myimage1 onclick="changeimage();"><img src="mypc.jpg" alt = "My picture" width="200" height="200"/> <p class = caption1>The inside of the PC I built</p></div>
    <script>
            $('.myimage1').click(function() {
                alert("That image had quite a glare and wasn't very good, how about this one?");
                $(this).fadeOut(1000, function() {
                    $('.myimage2').fadeIn(1000);
                });
            });
    </script>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Programming Languages I Know:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>C/C++</li>
        <li>SQL</li>
        <Li>HTML, CSS & JavaScript (Learning)</Li>
    </ul></br>
    <p style="font-size:20px;">Some of My Hobbies Include:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
        <li>Reading</li>
        <li>Playing Video Games on my PC</li>
        <li>Watching Youtube videos</li>
        <li>Learning new skills</li>
    </ul><br>
    <p style="font-size:20px;">Where I've Worked:</p>
    <p>My first work experience was helping the Media Specialist at Gulf Beaches Elementary Magnet School (2021-2023), this was volunteer work being done for my bright futures scholarship. During my time there
    I created spreadsheets detailing the school library inventory, including computers, ipads, books and other technology. Later at the same school (2022-2024) I ended up doing tutoring and some afterschool clubs related to the areas of STEM as well. Some of the skills
    I learned in these roles were how to explain new concepts to others and and some organization skills. Starting in 2024 I began doing some work for Mad Science of Greater Tampa Bay doing similar things, making spreadsheets, organizing resources, and made a company Onedrive so that the
    company files could be accessed remotely as needed. In these roles I also have done some video/photo editing work. In summer of 2025 I participated in the Global Career Accelerator: Coding For Data where I worked with both Python and SQL to analyze datasets in order to make data-backed conclusions and recommendations.
    At the same time I have been working on several projects independently to build up my portfolio, including this website, but several others as well
    some of which are included on the projects page or else on my LinkedIn posts.</p>
